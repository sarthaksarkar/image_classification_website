# LEGO Character Classifier

A web application that identifies LEGO characters from Marvel or Star Wars using a ResNet model built with TensorFlow. Users can upload an image, and the app will predict the character displayed in the image.

## Features
- **Character Classification**: Upload an image of a LEGO character, and the app will predict whether it belongs to Marvel or Star Wars and identify the character.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a ResNet model trained with TensorFlow for high accuracy.
- **Flask Backend**: Manages the server-side operations and prediction logic.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for file upload and user interface)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow (ResNet model)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
